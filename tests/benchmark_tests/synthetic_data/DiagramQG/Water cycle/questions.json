It comprises several stages, including evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and infiltration. When rainwater descends onto the land, it has the potential to be absorbed by plants or flow into bodies of water such as rivers and lakes. As water evaporates from these surfaces, it transforms into clouds, which eventually release precipitation through condensation. This continuous cycle replenishes our freshwater resources and plays a crucial role in sustaining life on Earth.",
