Sinusoidal waves can be either longitudinal (like sound) or transverse (like light). In the context of wave interference, there are two important phenomena: constructive interference and destructive interference.\n\nConstructive interference occurs when the crest of one wave aligns with the crest of another wave, leading to an amplification of the wave's amplitude. This happens because the waves add positively or are in-phase. On the other hand, destructive interference occurs when a crest of one wave meets a trough of another wave, causing a cancellation of amplitude. In this case, the waves subtract destructively or are out of phase by half a wavelength.\n\nThe degree of phase difference determines the nature of interference. In the illustration, two types of interference are depicted: constructive and destructive. In the top left diagram, two waves interfere constructively, resulting in a higher amplitude. In another part of the illustration, the waves cancel each other out, leading to zero amplitude or complete destructive interference. If the waves are out of phase by a full wavelength, destructive interference occurs.\n\nIn summary, wave interference demonstrates how waves can either amplify or diminish each other's strength depending on their phase relationship. This interaction ultimately affects the overall amplitude of the resulting wave pattern.",
