Light enters through the transparent cornea. The pupil, located at the center of the iris, controls the size of the entrance for light. The lens focuses light onto the retina, which is a layer of photoreceptor cells at the back of the eye.\n\nEach eye has a retina responsible for capturing light and converting it into electrical signals. These signals travel along the optic nerve, which transmits the information to the brain for processing. The eye also contains the anterior chamber with aqueous humor, a clear fluid, and multiple layers including the outer sclera and inner layers with the mentioned structures.\n\nThe iris, the colored part of the eye, varies in color between individuals. The optic nerve plays a crucial role in transmitting visual data to the brain.
