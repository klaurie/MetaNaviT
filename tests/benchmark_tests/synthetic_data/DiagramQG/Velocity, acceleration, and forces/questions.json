    "context": "Magnetic forces play a significant role in the interaction between two magnets. These forces can either be attractive or repulsive, depending on the type and orientation of the magnets involved. When two magnets with like poles (both north or both south) face each other, they experience a repulsive force that pushes them apart. On the other hand, when magnets with unlike poles (one north and one south) meet, an attractive force pulls them together.\n\nThe strength of the magnetic force depends on the magnetic field strength of the magnets and the distance between their centers. If one magnet in a pair is stronger than the other, it will exert a greater influence on the weaker magnet. Understanding these principles is crucial in various applications, including electromagnets, motors, and navigation systems.",
