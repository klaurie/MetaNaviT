# Time-Based Test Dataset

This dataset is designed to test MetaNaviT's temporal indexing capabilities.

## Timestamp Patterns

- Creation times reflect when documents were initially created
- Modification times show updates and revisions
- Files have meaningful temporal relationships

## File Organization

All files are placed in a flat structure to match the test_cases.json expectations.
