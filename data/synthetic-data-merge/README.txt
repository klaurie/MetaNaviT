# Synthetic Dataset for Merging and Summarization Testing

## Overview
This dataset is designed to test MetaNaviT's ability to merge and summarize information from multiple structured and unstructured sources. 
Each dataset contains at least two related files along with a human-generated summary for evaluation.

## Dataset Structure
The dataset consists of the following categories:

### 1. Sales Data & Customer Feedback
- **sales_data.csv**: Contains transaction details (Transaction ID, Date, Customer ID, Product, Amount, Region).
- **customer_feedback.csv**: Includes customer ratings and comments.
- **sales_feedback_summary.txt**: Summary of trends, insights, and sentiment analysis.

### 2. Research Paper & Notes
- **research_paper.docx**: A document summarizing AI in healthcare.
- **research_notes.txt**: Key points and annotations related to the research.
- **research_summary.txt**: Concise summary of core findings.

### 3. Legal Contract & Annotations
- **legal_contract.pdf**: A sample contract with key terms.
- **contract_annotations.txt**: Notes on important clauses and terms.
- **contract_summary.txt**: Summary of main contract elements.

### 4. Emails & Meeting Minutes
- **email_logs.txt**: Sample emails related to work communications.
- **meeting_minutes.docx**: Notes from a project-related meeting.
- **email_meeting_summary.txt**: Summary of key decisions and actions.

### 5. Medical Reports & Patient Notes
- **medical_report.pdf**: A structured patient medical report.
- **patient_notes.txt**: Informal doctor notes on patient conditions.
- **medical_summary.txt**: Summary of diagnoses, treatments, and recommendations.

## Merging & Summarization Goals
- **Identify and combine relevant data** from multiple sources into a unified format.
- **Summarize key insights concisely** while preserving essential information.
- **Handle structured and unstructured formats** effectively.

## Future Steps
This dataset will be used to develop and test MetaNaviTâ€™s merging and summarization capabilities. The next phase involves implementing and evaluating the merging and summarization models.
