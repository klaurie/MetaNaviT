Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Introduction:
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models specifically designed for processing structured grid data, such as images. They are widely used in image recognition, object detection, and other computer vision tasks.

Architecture of CNNs:
CNNs consist of several key layers:

1. Convolutional Layer:
   - Applies a set of filters (kernels) to input images to extract features such as edges, textures, and patterns.
   - Each filter slides over the input and performs element-wise multiplication, producing feature maps.

2. Activation Function:
   - A nonlinear activation function (commonly ReLU) is applied to introduce non-linearity into the model.
   - ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is defined as f(x) = max(0, x), helping the network learn complex patterns.

3. Pooling Layer:
   - Reduces spatial dimensions while retaining essential information.
   - Common types: Max Pooling (selects the maximum value in a region) and Average Pooling (computes the average).

4. Fully Connected Layer:
   - Flattens the feature maps and connects them to fully connected layers for classification or regression tasks.
   - Typically followed by a softmax function for multi-class classification.

5. Dropout Layer (Optional):
   - Reduces overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of the neurons to zero during training.

Training CNNs:
- CNNs are trained using backpropagation and optimization algorithms like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam.
- They require large datasets and computational resources for effective learning.

Applications of CNNs:
- Image Classification (e.g., ResNet, VGG, AlexNet)
- Object Detection (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN)
- Medical Image Analysis
- Autonomous Vehicles
- Facial Recognition

Conclusion:
CNNs have revolutionized computer vision by enabling accurate and automated image analysis. Their ability to learn hierarchical features makes them a powerful tool in deep learning applications.
